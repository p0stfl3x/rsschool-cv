## About me
I'd like to become a front-end software engineer.
I've been working in IT for some years as a non-technical employee, tried learning a few paths like testing, ux-design and python\web programming, which led me to understanding that the latter fits me the most.

I enjoy creating something new using logic, rather than some artistic skills or searching for errors.

Web engineering holds a lot of opportunities in our modern fast-changing world: there's a growing range of practical uses it provides, from industrial software development to progressive web applications.
That's why I've chosen Rolling Scopes School as a starting point of this journey to become a web developer.

My core strengths are: logical thinking, diligence, good soft skills and willingness to learn.
